# Using AWS Application Load Balancer with Azure Active Directory to authenticate requests

Backstage allows offloading the responsibility of authenticating users to an AWS Application Load Balancer (**ALB**), leveraging the authentication support on ALB.
This tutorial shows how to use authentication on an ALB sitting in front of Backstage.
Azure Active Directory (**AAD**) is used as identity provider but any identity provider supporting OpenID Connect (OIDC) can be used.

It is assumed an ALB is already serving traffic in front of a Backstage instance configured to serve the frontend app from the backend.

## Infrastructure setup

### AAD App

The AAD App is used to execute the authentication flow, serve and refresh the identity token.

Create the AAD App following the steps outlined in `Create a Microsoft App Registration in Microsoft Portal` section from the tutorial [Monorepo App Setup With Authentication][monorepo-app-setup-with-auth].

Instead of `localhost` addresses, use the following values.

- Identifier URI: `https://backstage.yourdomain.com`
- Redirect URI: `https://backstage.yourdomain.com/oauth2/idpresponse`

`Application (client) Id`, `Directory (tenant) ID` and `client secret`values will be used while configuring the ALB.

### ALB

In the AWS console, configure ALB Authentication:

- Edit the ALB rule used to forward the traffic to Backstage and add a new `Authenticate` action. The action will have higher priority compared to the existing `Forward to`.
- Select `OIDC` under `Authenticate`
- Set `Issuer` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0`, replacing `{TENANT_ID}` with the value of `Directory (tenant) ID` of the AAD App.
- Set `Authorization endpoint` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`, replacing `{TENANT_ID}` with the value of `Directory (tenant) ID` of the AAD App.
- Set `Token endpoint` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`, replacing `{TENANT_ID}` with the value of `Directory (tenant) ID` of the AAD App.
- Set `User info endpoint` to `https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo`
- Set `Client ID` to the AAD App `Application (client) Id`
- Set `Client secret` to the AAD APP `client secret`

Use the following advanced settings:

- `Session cookie name` = `AWSELBAuthSessionCookie`
- `Session timeout` = `604800` seconds
- `Scope` = `openid profile offline_access`
- `Action on unauthenticated request` = `Autenticate (client reattempt)`

Once you've saved the action, you should see an authentication flow be triggered against AAD when visiting Backstage address at `https://backstage.yourdomain.com`. The flow will not complete successfully as the Backstage app isn't yet configured properly.

## Backstage changes

### Frontend

The Backstage App needs a SignInPage when authentication is required.
When using ALB authentication Backstage will only be loaded once the user has successfully authenticated; we won't need to display a SignIn page, however we will need to create a dummy SignIn component that can refresh the token.

- edit `packages/app/src/App.tsx`
- import the following two additional definitions from `@backstage/core`: `useApi`, `configApiRef`; these will be used to check whether Backstage is running locally or behind an ALB
- add the following definition just before the app is created (`const app = createApp`):

```ts
const DummySignInComponent: any = (props: any) => {
  try {
    const config = useApi(configApiRef);
    const shouldAuth = !!config.getOptionalConfig('auth.providers.awsalb');
    if (shouldAuth) {
      fetch(`${window.location.origin}/api/auth/awsalb/refresh`)
        .then(data => data.json())
        .then(data => {
          props.onResult({
            userId: data.backstageIdentity.id,
            profile: data.profile,
          });
        });
    } else {
      props.onResult({
        userId: 'guest',
        profile: {
          email: 'guest@example.com',
          displayName: 'Guest',
          picture: '',
        },
      });
    }
    return <div />;
  } catch (err) {
    return <div>{err.message}</div>;
  }
};
```

- add `DummySignInComponent` as `SignInPage`:

```ts
const app = createApp({
  ...
  components: {
    SignInPage: DummySignInComponent,
    ...
  },
  ...
});
```

### Backend

When using ALB auth it is not possible to leverage the built-in auth config discovery mechanism implemented in the app created by default; bespoke logic needs to be implemented.

- replace the content of `packages/backend/plugin/auth.ts` with the below

```ts
import {
  createRouter,
  AuthResponse,
  AuthProviderFactoryOptions,
  defaultAuthProviderFactories,
} from '@backstage/plugin-auth-backend';
import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';

export default async function createPlugin({
  logger,
  database,
  config,
  discovery,
}: PluginEnvironment) {
  const identityResolver = (payload: any): Promise<AuthResponse<any>> => {
    return Promise.resolve({
      providerInfo: {},
      profile: {
        email: payload.email,
        displayName: payload.name,
        picture: payload.picture,
      },
      backstageIdentity: {
        id: payload.email,
      },
    });
  };
  const providerFactories = {
    awsalb: (options: AuthProviderFactoryOptions) =>
      defaultAuthProviderFactories.awsalb({ ...options, identityResolver }),
  };
  return await createRouter({
    logger,
    config,
    database,
    discovery,
    providerFactories,
  });
}
```

### Configuration

Use the following `auth` configuration when running Backstage on AWS:

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    awsalb:
      issuer:
        issuer: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}/v2.0
        region: { AWS_REGION }
```

Replace `{TENANT_ID}` with the value of `Directory (tenant) ID` of the AAD App and `{AWS_REGION}` with the AWS region identifier where the ALB is deployed (for example: `eu-central-1`).

## Conclusion

Once it's deployed, after going through the AAD authentication flow, Backstage should display the AAD user details.
