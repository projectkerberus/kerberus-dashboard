This terraform file should create a S3 bucket and setup IAM with a user with an inline policy which gives the user access to the bucket. After you have created the bucket, user and policy you should go to the user in the AWS console and create an access key. This access key should be used as the env variables in step 3a [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage#configuring-aws-s3-bucket-with-techdocs).
