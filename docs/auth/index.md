description: How to add authentication to a Backstage application
---

Authentication in Backstage identifies the user, and provides a way for plugins
to make requests on behalf of a user to third-party services. Backstage can have
zero (guest access), one, or many authentication providers. The default
`@backstage/create-app` template uses guest access for easy startup.

See [Using authentication and identity](using-auth.md) for tips on using
Backstage identity information in your app or plugins.

## Adding an authentication provider

Backstage comes with many common authentication providers in the core library:

- [Auth0](auth0/provider.md)
- [Azure](microsoft/provider.md)
- [GitHub](github/provider.md)
- [GitLab](gitlab/provider.md)
- [Google](google/provider.md)
- [Okta](okta/provider.md)
- [OneLogin](onelogin/provider.md)

These built-in providers handle the authentication flow for a particular service
including required scopes, callbacks, etc. These providers are each added to a
Backstage app in a similar way.

### Adding provider configuration

Each built-in provider has a configuration block under the `auth` section of
`app-config.yaml`. For example, the GitHub provider:

```yaml
auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

See the documentation for a particular provider to see what configuration is
needed.

The `providers` key may have several authentication providers, if multiple
authentication methods are supported. Each provider may also have configuration
for different authentication environments (development, production, etc). This
allows a single auth backend to serve multiple environments, such as running a
local frontend against a deployed backend. The provider configuration matching
the local `auth.environment` setting will be selected.

### Adding the provider to the sign-in page

After configuring an authentication provider, the `app` frontend package needs a
small update to show this provider as a login option. The `SignInPage` component
handles this, and takes either a `provider` or `providers` (array) prop of
`SignInProviderConfig` definitions.

These reference the [ApiRef](../reference/utility-apis/README.md) exported by
the provider. Again, an example using GitHub that can be adapted to any of the
built-in providers:

```diff
# packages/app/src/App.tsx
+ import { githubAuthApiRef, SignInProviderConfig, SignInPage } from '@backstage/core';

+ const githubProvider: SignInProviderConfig = {
+  id: 'github-auth-provider',
+  title: 'GitHub',
+  message: 'Sign in using GitHub',
+  apiRef: githubAuthApiRef,
+};
+
const app = createApp({
  apis,
+  components: {
+    SignInPage: props => (
+      <SignInPage
+        {...props}
+        auto
+        provider={githubProvider}
+      />
+    ),
+  },
  bindRoutes({ bind }) {
```

To also allow unauthenticated guest access, use the `providers` prop for
`SignInPage`:

```diff
const app = createApp({
  apis,
+  components: {
+    SignInPage: props => (
+      <SignInPage
+        {...props}
+        providers={['guest', githubProvider]}
+      />
+    ),
+  },
  bindRoutes({ bind }) {
```

## Adding a custom authentication provider

There are generic authentication providers for OAuth2 and SAML. These can reduce
the amount of code needed to implement a custom authentication provider that
adheres to these standards.

Backstage uses [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) under the hood, which has
a wide library of authentication strategies for different providers. See
[Add authentication provider](add-auth-provider.md) for details on adding a new
Passport-supported authentication method.
