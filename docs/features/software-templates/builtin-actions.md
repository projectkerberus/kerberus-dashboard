The scaffolder comes with several built-in actions for fetching content,
registering in the catalog and of course actions for creating and publishing a
git repository.

There are several repository providers supported out of the box such as GitHub,
Azure, GitLab and Bitbucket.

A list of all registered actions can be found under `/create/actions`. For local
development you should be able to reach them at
`http://localhost:3000/create/actions`.
