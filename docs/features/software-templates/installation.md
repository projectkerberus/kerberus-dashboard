The scaffolder plugin comes in two packages, `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder` and
`@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`. Each has their own installation steps,
outlined below.

The Scaffolder plugin also depends on the Software Catalog. Instructions for how
to set that up can be found [here](../software-catalog/installation.md).

## Installing @backstage/plugin-scaffolder

> **Note that if you used `npx @backstage/create-app`, the plugin may already be
> present**

The scaffolder frontend plugin should be installed in your `app` package, which
is created as a part of `@backstage/create-app`. To install the package, run:

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
cd packages/app
yarn add @backstage/plugin-scaffolder
```

### Adding the Plugin to your `packages/app`

Add the root page that the Scaffolder plugin provides to your app. You can
choose any path for the route, but we recommend the following:

```tsx
import { ScaffolderPage } from '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder';

// Add to the top-level routes, directly within <FlatRoutes>
<Route path="/create" element={<ScaffolderPage />} />;
```

You may also want to add a link to the template index page to your sidebar:

```tsx
import CreateComponentIcon from '@material-ui/icons/AddCircleOutline';

// Somewhere within the <Sidebar>
<SidebarItem icon={CreateComponentIcon} to="create" text="Create..." />;
```

This is all that is needed for the frontend part of the Scaffolder plugin to
work!

## Installing @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend

> **Note that if you used `npx @backstage/create-app`, the plugin may already be
> present**

The scaffolder backend should be installed in your `backend` package, which is
created as a part of `@backstage/create-app`. To install the package, run:

```bash
# From your Backstage root directory
cd packages/backend
yarn add @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend
```

### Adding the Plugin to your `packages/backend`

You'll need to add the plugin to the `backend`'s router. You can do this by
creating a file called `packages/backend/src/plugins/scaffolder.ts` with the
following contents to get you up and running quickly.

```ts
import {
  DockerContainerRunner,
  SingleHostDiscovery,
} from '@backstage/backend-common';
import {
  CookieCutter,
  createRouter,
  Preparers,
  Publishers,
  CreateReactAppTemplater,
  Templaters,
} from '@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend';
import type { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
import Docker from 'dockerode';
import { CatalogClient } from '@backstage/catalog-client';

export default async function createPlugin({
  logger,
  config,
  database,
  reader,
}: PluginEnvironment) {
  const dockerClient = new Docker();
  const containerRunner = new DockerContainerRunner({ dockerClient });

  const cookiecutterTemplater = new CookieCutter({ containerRunner });
  const craTemplater = new CreateReactAppTemplater({ containerRunner });
  const templaters = new Templaters();

  templaters.register('cookiecutter', cookiecutterTemplater);
  templaters.register('cra', craTemplater);

  const preparers = await Preparers.fromConfig(config, { logger });
  const publishers = await Publishers.fromConfig(config, { logger });

  const discovery = SingleHostDiscovery.fromConfig(config);
  const catalogClient = new CatalogClient({ discoveryApi: discovery });

  return await createRouter({
    preparers,
    templaters,
    publishers,
    logger,
    config,
    database,
    catalogClient,
    reader,
  });
}
```

Once the `scaffolder.ts` router setup file is in place, add the router to
`packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

```ts
import scaffolder from './plugins/scaffolder';

const scaffolderEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('scaffolder'));

const apiRouter = Router();
/* several router .use calls */

/* add this line */
apiRouter.use('/scaffolder', await scaffolder(scaffolderEnv));
```

### Adding Templates

At this point the scaffolder backend is installed in your backend package, but
you will not have any templates available to use. These need to be added to the
software catalog, as they are represented as entities of kind
[Template](../software-catalog/descriptor-format.md#kind-template). You can find
out more about adding templates [here](./adding-templates.md).

To get up and running and try out some templates quickly, you can add some of
our example templates through static configuration. Add the following to the
`catalog.locations` section in your `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    # Backstage Example Templates
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/scaffolder-backend/sample-templates/react-ssr-template/template.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/scaffolder-backend/sample-templates/springboot-grpc-template/template.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/scaffolder-backend/sample-templates/create-react-app/template.yaml
    - type: url
      target: https://github.com/spotify/cookiecutter-golang/blob/master/template.yaml
```

### Runtime Dependencies / Configuration

For the scaffolder backend plugin to function, you'll need to setup the
integrations config in your `app-config.yaml`.

You can find help for different providers below.

> Note: Some of this configuration may already be set up as part of your
> `app-config.yaml`. We're moving away from the duplicated config for
> authentication in the `scaffolder` section and using `integrations` instead.

#### GitHub

The GitHub access token is retrieved from environment variables via the config.
The config file needs to specify what environment variable the token is
retrieved from. Your config should have the following objects.

You can configure who can see the new repositories that the scaffolder creates
by specifying `visibility` option. Valid options are `public`, `private` and
`internal`. The `internal` option is for GitHub Enterprise clients, which means
public within the enterprise.

```yaml
integrations:
  github:
    - host: github.com
      token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}

scaffolder:
  github:
    visibility: public # or 'internal' or 'private'
```

#### GitLab

For GitLab, we currently support the configuration of the GitLab publisher and
allows to configure the private access token and the base URL of a GitLab
instance:

```yaml
integrations:
  gitlab:
    - host: gitlab.com
      token: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}
```

#### Bitbucket

For Bitbucket there are two authentication methods supported. Either `token` or
a combination of `appPassword` and `username`. It looks like either of the
following:

```yaml
integrations:
  bitbucket:
    - host: bitbucket.org
      token: ${BITBUCKET_TOKEN}
```

or

```yaml
integrations:
  bitbucket:
    - host: bitbucket.org
      appPassword: ${BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD}
      username: ${BITBUCKET_USERNAME}
```

#### Azure DevOps

For Azure DevOps we support both the preparer and publisher stage with the
configuration of a private access token (PAT). For the publisher it's also
required to define the base URL for the client to connect to the service. This
will hopefully support on-prem installations as well but that has not been
verified.

```yaml
integrations:
  azure:
    - host: dev.azure.com
      token: ${AZURE_TOKEN}
```

### Running the Backend

Finally, make sure you have a local Docker daemon running, and start up the
backend with the new configuration:

```bash
cd packages/backend
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> yarn start
```

If you've also set up the frontend plugin, so you should be ready to go browse
the templates at [localhost:3000/create](http://localhost:3000/create) now!

### Disabling Docker in Docker situation (Optional)

Software Templates use
[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) as templating
library. By default it will use the
[spotify/backstage-cookiecutter](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/37e35b910afc7d1270855aed0ec4718aba366c91/plugins/scaffolder-backend/scripts/Cookiecutter.dockerfile)
docker image.

If you are running Backstage from a Docker container and you want to avoid
calling a container inside a container, you can set up Cookiecutter in your own
image, this will use the local installation instead.

You can do so by including the following lines in the last step of your
`Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install cookiecutter
```
