Templates are stored in the **Service Catalog** under a kind `Template`. You can
create your own templates with a small `yaml` definition which describes the
template and it's metadata, along with some input variables that your template
will need, and then a list of actions which are then executed by the scaffolding
service.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

```yaml
# Notice the v1beta2 version
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1beta2
kind: Template
# some metadata about the template itself
metadata:
  name: v1beta2-demo
  title: Test Action template
  description: scaffolder v1beta2 template demo
spec:
  owner: backstage/techdocs-core
  type: service

  # these are the steps which are rendered in the frontend with the form input
  parameters:
    - title: Fill in some steps
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          title: Name
          type: string
          description: Unique name of the component
          ui:autofocus: true
          ui:options:
            rows: 5
        owner:
          title: Owner
          type: string
          description: Owner of the component
          ui:field: OwnerPicker
          ui:options:
            allowedKinds:
              - Group
    - title: Choose a location
      required:
        - repoUrl
      properties:
        repoUrl:
          title: Repository Location
          type: string
          ui:field: RepoUrlPicker
          ui:options:
            allowedHosts:
              - github.com

  # here's the steps that are executed in series in the scaffolder backend
  steps:
    - id: fetch-base
      name: Fetch Base
      action: fetch:cookiecutter
      input:
        url: ./template
        values:
          name: '{{ parameters.name }}'
          owner: '{{ parameters.owner }}'

    - id: fetch-docs
      name: Fetch Docs
      action: fetch:plain
      input:
        targetPath: ./community
        url: https://github.com/backstage/community/tree/main/backstage-community-sessions

    - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:github
      input:
        allowedHosts: ['github.com']
        description: 'This is {{ parameters.name }}'
        repoUrl: '{{ parameters.repoUrl }}'

    - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        repoContentsUrl: '{{ steps.publish.output.repoContentsUrl }}'
        catalogInfoPath: '/catalog-info.yaml'

  # some outputs which are saved along with the job for use in the frontend
  output:
    remoteUrl: '{{ steps.publish.output.remoteUrl }}'
    entityRef: '{{ steps.register.output.entityRef }}'
```

Let's dive in an pick apart what each of these sections do and what they are.

### `spec.parameters` - `FormStep | FormStep[]`

These `parameters` are template variables which can be modified in the frontend
as a sequence. It can either be one `Step` if you just want one big list of
different fields in the frontend, or it can be broken up into multiple different
steps which would be rendered as different steps in the scaffolder plugin
frontend.

Each `Step` is `JSONSchema` with some extra goodies for styling what it might
look like in the frontend. For these steps we rely very heavily on this library:
https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form. They have some great docs
too here: https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/ and a playground where
you can play around with some examples here
https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form.

There's another option for that library called `uiSchema` which we've taken
advantage of, and we've merged it with the existing `JSONSchema` that you
provide to the library. These are the little `ui:*` properties that you can see
in the step definitions.

For example if we take the **simple** example from the playground it looks like
this:

```json
// jsonSchema:
{
  "title": "A registration form",
  "description": "A simple form example.",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "firstName",
    "lastName"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "First name",
      "default": "Chuck"
    },
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Last name"
    },
    "nicknames":{
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "telephone": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Telephone",
      "minLength": 10
    }
  }
}

// uiSchema:
{
  "firstName": {
    "ui:autofocus": true,
    "ui:emptyValue": "",
    "ui:autocomplete": "family-name"
  },
  "lastName": {
    "ui:emptyValue": "",
    "ui:autocomplete": "given-name"
  },
  "nicknames": {
    "ui:options":{
      "orderable": false
    }
  },
  "telephone": {
    "ui:options": {
      "inputType": "tel"
    }
  }
}
```

It would look something like the following in a template:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1beta2
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: v1beta2-demo
  title: Test Action template
  description: scaffolder v1beta2 template demo
spec:
  owner: backstage/techdocs-core
  type: service

  parameters:
    - title: A registration form
      description: A simple form example.
      type: object
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
          title: First name
          default: Chuck
          ui:autofocus: true
          ui:emptyValue: ''
          ui:autocomplete: family-name
        lastName:
          type: string
          title: Last name
          ui:emptyValue: ''
          ui:autocomplete: given-name
        nicknames:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          ui:options:
            orderable: false
        telephone:
          type: string
          title: Telephone
          minLength: 10
          ui:options:
            inputType: tel
```

#### The Repository Picker

So in order to make working with repository providers easier, we've built a
custom picker that can be used by overriding the `ui:field` option in the
`uiSchema` for a `string` field. Instead of displaying a text input block it
will render our custom component that we've built which makes it easy to select
a repository provider, and insert a project or owner, and repository name.

You can see it in the above full example which is a separate step and it looks a
little like this:

```yaml
- title: Choose a location
  required:
    - repoUrl
  properties:
    repoUrl:
      title: Repository Location
      type: string
      ui:field: RepoUrlPicker
      ui:options:
        allowedHosts:
          - github.com
```

The `allowedHosts` part should be set to where you wish to enable this template
to publish to. And it can be any host that is listed in your `integrations`
config in `app-config.yaml`.

The `RepoUrlPicker` is a custom field that we provide part of the
`plugin-scaffolder`. It's currently not possible to create your own fields yet,
but contributions are welcome! :)

#### The Owner Picker

When the scaffolder needs to add new components to the catalog, it needs to have
an owner for them. Ideally, users should be able to select an owner when they go
through the scaffolder form from the users and groups already known to
Backstage. The `OwnerPicker` is a custom field that generates a searchable list
of groups and/or users already in the catalog to pick an owner from. You can
specify which of the two kinds are listed in the `allowedKinds` option:

```yaml
owner:
  title: Owner
  type: string
  description: Owner of the component
  ui:field: OwnerPicker
  ui:options:
    allowedKinds:
      - Group
```

### `spec.steps` - `Action[]`

The `steps` is an array of the things that you want to happen part of this
template. These follow the same standard format:

```yaml
- id: fetch-base # A unique id for the step
  name: Fetch Base # A title displayed in the frontend
  if: '{{ parameters.name }}' # Optional condition, skip the step if not truthy
  action: fetch:cookiecutter # an action to call
  input: # input that is passed as arguments to the action handler
    url: ./template
    values:
      name: '{{ parameters.name }}'
```

By default we ship some built in actions that you can take a look at
[here](./builtin-actions.md), or you can create your own custom actions by
looking at the docs [here](./writing-custom-actions.md)

### Outputs

Each individual step can output some variables that can be used in the
scaffolder frontend for after the job is finished. This is useful for things
like linking to the entity that has been created with the backend, and also
linking to the created repository.

The main two that are used are the following:

```yaml
output:
  remoteUrl: '{{ steps.publish.output.remoteUrl }}' # link to the remote repository
  entityRef: '{{ steps.register.output.entityRef }}' # link to the entity that has been ingested to the catalog
```

### The templating syntax

You might have noticed in the examples that there are `{{ }}`, and these are a
`handlebars` templates for linking and glueing all these different parts of
`yaml` together. All the form inputs from the `parameters` section, when passed
to the steps will be available by using the template syntax
`{{ parameters.something }}`. This is great for passing the values from the form
into different steps and reusing these input variables. To pass arrays or
objects use the syntax `{{ json paramaters.something }}` where
`paramaters.something` is of type `object` or `array` in the `jsonSchema`, such
as the `nicknames` parameter in the previous example.

As you can see above in the `Outputs` section, `actions` and `steps` can also
output things. So you can grab that output by using
`steps.$stepId.output.$property`.

You can read more about all the `inputs` and `outputs` defined in the actions in
code part of the `JSONSchema` or you can read more about our built in ones
[here](./builtin-actions.md).
