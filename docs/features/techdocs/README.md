## What is it?

<!-- Intro, backstory, etc.: -->

TechDocs is Spotifyâ€™s homegrown docs-like-code solution built directly into
Backstage. This means engineers write their documentation in Markdown files
which live together with their code.

Today, it is one of the core products in Spotifyâ€™s developer experience offering
with 2,400+ documentation sites and 1,000+ engineers using it daily. Read more
about TechDocs and the philosophy in its
[announcement blog post](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs).

## Project roadmap

### **Ongoing work ðŸš§**

**Beta release** -
[Milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/29)

- It should be possible and easy to use TechDocs in most environments across
  organizations.
- Minimal bugs, better error handling and scalable backend and frontend.
- Documentation Search
- TechDocs Homepage with basic features

### **Future work ðŸ”®**

**General Availability (GA) release** -
[Milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/30)

- Bugs are rare, TechDocs APIs are stable and scales easily in large
  organizations.
- Better integration with
  [Scaffolder V2](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771) (e.g. easy
  to choose and plug documentation template with Software Templates).
- Possible to configure several aspects about TechDocs (e.g. URL, homepage,
  theme).

**Implement Feedback loop** -
[Milestone](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/31)

- A feedback loop between documentation reader and writer using TechDocs
- The `+` in `docs-like-code+` experience

**TechDocs widget framework**

Platformize TechDocs with a widget framework so that it is easy for TechDocs
contributors to add pieces of functionality and for users to choose which
functionalities they want to adopt. As a pre-requisite, the re-architecture of
TechDocs frontend [RFC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/3998)
needs to be addressed.
