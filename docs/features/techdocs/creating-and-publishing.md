This section will guide you through:

- [Create a basic documentation setup](#create-a-basic-documentation-setup)
  - [Use the documentation template](#use-the-documentation-template)
  - [Manually add documentation setup to already existing repository](#manually-add-documentation-setup-to-already-existing-repository)
- [Writing and previewing your documentation](#writing-and-previewing-your-documentation)

## Prerequisites

- A working Backstage instance with TechDocs installed (see
  [TechDocs getting started](getting-started.md))

## Create a basic documentation setup

If you have an existing repository that you'd like to add documentation to, skip
to the
[Manually add documentation setup](#manually-add-documentation-setup-to-already-existing-repository)
section below. Otherwise, continue reading to start a documentation repo from
scratch.

### Use the documentation template

Your working Backstage instance should by default have a documentation template
added. If not, follow these
[instructions](../software-templates/installation.md#adding-templates) to add
the documentation template. The template creates a component with only TechDocs
configuration and default markdown files as below mentioned in manual
documentation setup, and is otherwise empty.

![Documentation Template](../../assets/techdocs/documentation-template.png)

Create an entity from the documentation template and you will get the needed
setup for free.

### Manually add documentation setup to already existing repository

Prerequisites:

- An existing component
  [registered in backstage](../software-catalog/index.md#adding-components-to-the-catalog)
  (e.g. via a `catalog-info.yaml` file).

Create an `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your repository with the following
content:

```yaml
site_name: 'example-docs'

nav:
  - Home: index.md

plugins:
  - techdocs-core
```

Update your component's entity description by adding the following lines to its
`catalog-info.yaml` in the root of its repository:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    backstage.io/techdocs-ref: url:https://github.com/org/repo
    # Or
    # backstage.io/techdocs-ref: url:https://github.com/org/repo/tree/branchName/subFolder
```

The
[`backstage.io/techdocs-ref` annotation](../software-catalog/well-known-annotations.md#backstageiotechdocs-ref)
is used by TechDocs to download the documentation source files for generating an
Entity's TechDocs site.

Create a `/docs` folder in the root of the project with at least an `index.md`
file. _(If you add more markdown files, make sure to update the nav in the
mkdocs.yml file to get a proper navigation for your documentation.)_

> Note - Although `docs` is a popular directory name for storing documentation,
> it can be renamed to something else and can be configured by `mkdocs.yml`. See
> https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#docs_dir

The `docs/index.md` can for example have the following content:

```md
# example docs

This is a basic example of documentation.
```

Commit your changes, open a pull request and merge. You will now get your
updated documentation next time you run Backstage!

## Writing and previewing your documentation

Using the `techdocs-cli` you can preview your docs inside a local Backstage
instance and get live reload on changes. This is useful when you want to preview
your documentation while writing.

To do this you can run:

```bash
cd /path/to/docs-repository/
npx @techdocs/cli serve
```
