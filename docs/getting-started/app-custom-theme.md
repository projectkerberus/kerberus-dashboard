Backstage ships with a default theme with a light and dark mode variant. The
themes are provided as a part of the
[@backstage/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/theme) package,
which also includes utilities for customizing the default theme, or creating
completely new themes.

## Creating a Custom Theme

The easiest way to create a new theme is to use the `createTheme` function
exported by the
[@backstage/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/theme) package. You
can use it to override so basic parameters of the default theme such as the
color palette and font.

For example, you can create a new theme based on the default light theme like
this:

```ts
import { createTheme, lightTheme } from '@backstage/theme';

const myTheme = createTheme({
  palette: lightTheme.palette,
  fontFamily: 'Comic Sans MS',
  defaultPageTheme: 'home',
});
```

If you want more control over the theme, and for example customize font sizes
and margins, you can use the lower-level `createThemeOverrides` function
exported by [@backstage/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/theme)
in combination with
[createMuiTheme](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/#createmuitheme-options-args-theme)
from [@material-ui/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core). See
the
[@backstage/theme source](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/theme/src)
and the implementation of the `createTheme` function for how this is done.

You can also create a theme from scratch that matches the `BackstageTheme` type
exported by [@backstage/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/theme).
See the
[material-ui docs on theming](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/)
for more information about how that can be done.

## Using your Custom Theme

To add a custom theme to your Backstage app, you pass it as configuration to
`createApp`.

For example, adding the theme that we created in the previous section can be
done like this:

```ts
import { createApp } from '@backstage/core';

const app = createApp({
  apis: ...,
  plugins: ...,
  themes: [{
    id: 'my-theme',
    title: 'My Custom Theme',
    variant: 'light',
    theme: myTheme,
  }]
})
```

Note that your list of custom themes overrides the default themes. If you still
want to use the default themes, they are exported as `lightTheme` and
`darkTheme` from
[@backstage/theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@backstage/theme).

## Example of a custom theme

```ts
const themeOptions = createThemeOptions({
  palette: {
    ...lightTheme.palette,
    primary: {
      main: '#123456',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#123456',
    },
    error: {
      main: '#123456'
    },
    warning: {
      main: '#123456',
    },
    info: {
      main: '#123456',
    },
    success: {
      main: '#123456',
    },
    background: {
      default: '#123456',
      paper: '#123456',
    },
    banner: {
      info: '#123456',
      error: '#123456'
      text: '#123456'
      link: '#123456',
    },
    errorBackground: '#123456'
    warningBackground: '#123456'
    infoBackground: '#123456'
    navigation: {
      background: '#123456',
      indicator: '#123456'
      color: '#123456'
      selectedColor: '#123456',
    },
  },
  defaultPageTheme: 'home',
  fontFamily: 'Comic Sans',
  /* below drives the header colors */
  pageTheme: {
    home: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
    documentation: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave2),
    tool: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.round),
    service: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
    website: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
    library: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'] shapes.wave),
    other: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
    app: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
    apis: genPageTheme(['#123456','#123456'], shapes.wave),
  },
});
```

## Custom Logo

In addition to a custom theme, you can also customize the logo displayed at the
far top left of the site.

In your frontend app, locate `src/components/Root/` folder. You'll find two
components:

- `LogoFull.tsx` - A larger logo used when the Sidebar navigation is opened.
- `LogoIcon.tsx` - A smaller logo used when the sidebar navigation is closed.

To replace the images, you can simply replace the relevant code in those
components with raw SVG definitions.

You can also use another web image format such as PNG by importing it. To do
this, place your new image into a new subdirectory such as
`src/components/Root/logo/my-company-logo.png`, and then add this code:

```jsx
import MyCustomLogoFull from './logo/my-company-logo.png';

//...

const LogoFull = () => {
  return <img src={MyCustomLogoFull} />;
};
```
