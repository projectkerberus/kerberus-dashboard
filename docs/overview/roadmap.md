description: Roadmap of Backstage Project
---

## Current status

> Backstage is currently under rapid development. This means that you can expect
> APIs and features to evolve. It is also recommended that teams who adopt
> Backstage today [upgrade their installation](../cli/commands.md#versionsbump)
> as new [releases](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases) become
> available, as Backwards compatibility is not yet guaranteed.

## Phases

We have divided the project into three high-level _phases_:

- üê£ **Phase 1:** Extensible frontend platform (Done ‚úÖ) - You will be able to
  easily create a single consistent UI layer for your internal infrastructure
  and tools. A set of reusable
  [UX patterns and components](https://backstage.io/storybook) help ensure a
  consistent experience between tools.

- üê¢ **Phase 2:** Service Catalog
  ([alpha released](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/06/22/backstage-service-catalog-alpha)) -
  With a single catalog, Backstage makes it easy for a team to manage ten
  services ‚Äî and makes it possible for your company to manage thousands of them.

- üêá **Phase 3:** Ecosystem (ongoing, see
  [Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)) - Everyone's
  infrastructure stack is different. By fostering a vibrant community of
  contributors we hope to provide an ecosystem of Open Source
  plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the tools that match your stack.

guidelines to get started.

### Ongoing work üöß

- **[Platform stabilization](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/19)** -
  Stabilize the core of Backstage, including its core features, so that the
  platform can be depended on for production use. After this, plugins will
  require little-to-no maintenance.

- **[Kubernetes plugin for service owners](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2857)** -
  Improve native support for Kubernetes, making it easier for service owners to
  see and manage their services running in K8s, regardless if that's locally, in
  AWS, GCS, Azure, or elsewhere.

- **[Search platform](../features/search/README.md)** - Evolve the basic search
  functionality currently available into a platform that **a)** enables search
  across the software catalog, TechDocs, and any other information exposed by
  plugins, and **b)** supports a variety of search engine technologies.

- **[Software Templates V2](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771)** -
  Expand the templates to make the steps more composable by adding the ability
  to add more steps for custom logic, including webhooks and using authorization
  from integrations.

### Future work üîÆ

- **Golden Path for Plugin Development** - Create an easy, standardized way for
  developers to build plugins that will encourage contributions and lead to a
  richer ecosystem for everyone.

- **[GraphQL API](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/milestone/13)** - A
  GraphQL API will open up the rich metadata provided by Backstage in a single
  query. Plugins can easily query this API as well as extend the model where
  needed.

- **Inter-Plugin Communication** - **[Under consideration]** Establish more
  clearly defined patterns for plugins to communicate.

- **Improved Access Control** - **[Under consideration]** Provide finer grained
  access controls and management for better control of the platform user
  experience.

### Plugins

Building and maintaining [plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins) is the work of
the entire Backstage community.

A list of plugins that are in development is
[available here](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplugin+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
We strongly recommend to upvote üëç plugins you are interested in. This helps us
and the community prioritize what plugins to build.

Are you missing a plugin for your favorite tool? Please
[suggest a new one](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/new?labels=plugin&template=plugin_template.md&title=%5BPlugin%5D+THE+PLUGIN+NAME).
Chances are that someone will jump in and help build it.

### Community Initiatives üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

- [**Backstage Community Sessions**](https://github.com/backstage/community#meetups) -
  A monthly meetup for the community to come together to share and learn about
  the latest happenings in Backstage.

- **Backstage Hackathons** - (Coming soon) Open to everyone in our Backstage
  community, a celebration of you, the project and building awesome things
  together
