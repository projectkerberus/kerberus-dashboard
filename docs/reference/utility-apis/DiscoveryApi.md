### getBaseUrl()

Returns the HTTP base backend URL for a given plugin, without a trailing slash.

This method must always be called just before making a request, as opposed to
fetching the URL when constructing an API client. That is to ensure that more
flexible routing patterns can be supported.

For example, asking for the URL for `auth` may return something like
`https://backstage.example.com/api/auth`

<pre>
getBaseUrl(pluginId: string): Promise&lt;string&gt;
</pre>
