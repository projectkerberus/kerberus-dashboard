# Plugins

Backstage is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins. This folder holds numerous plugins that are managed by this repository.

For more information about the plugin ecosystem, see the documentation here:

> https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/

You can also see the [Plugin Marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins) for other open source plugins you can add to your Backstage instance.

## Suggesting a plugin

If you start developing a plugin that you aim to release as open source, we suggest that you create a [new Issue](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/new?template=plugin_template.md). This helps the community know what plugins are in development.

You can also use this process if you have an idea for a good plugin but you hope that someone else will pick up the work.
