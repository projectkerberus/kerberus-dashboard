# @backstage/plugin-badges

The badges plugin offers a set of badges that can be used outside of
your backstage deployment, showing information related to data from
the catalog, such as entity owner and lifecycle data for instance.

The available badges are setup in the `badges-backend` plugin, see
link below for more details.

## Entity badges

To get markdown code for the entity badges, access the `Badges` context menu
(three dots in the upper right corner) of an entity page, which will popup a
badges dialog showing all available badges for that entity.
